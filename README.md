# BLE demo for Android
Bluetooth low energy (Bluetooth LE, BLE, marketed as Bluetooth Smart) is a wireless personal area network technology designed and marketed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, fitness, beacons, security, and home entertainment industries.

##How BLE works
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mihir-harbinger/BLE/master/ble-bulletin-board-model.png) 

Think of a Bluetooth LE peripheral device as a bulletin board and central devices as viewers of the board. Central devices view the services, get the data, then move on. Each transaction is quick (a few milliseconds), so multiple central devices can get data from one peripheral.

##Run this app
1. `git clone https://github.com/mihir-harbinger/BLE.git`
